# Event-Anomaly-Detection

Anomalies are rare and of varying nature and supervised learning approaches will fall short in terms of performance when dealing with such data. Auto-encoders however, are perfect for this situation, because they can be trained on normal parts and don't require annotated data. Once trained, we can give it a feature representation for a part and compare autoencoder output with input. The larger the difference, the more likely the input contains an anomaly.

We're submitting a.ipynb file with our project which is fairly easy to run once you have the necessary dataset 'UCSDâ€™s Anomaly Detection Dataset'
